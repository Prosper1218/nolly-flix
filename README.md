okay, so i started with just building out the ui, then, for the featured. all i did was map through the movies and check for ones with likes greater than 7 and display them in the featured section.
and for the Like functionality, i just mapped through the movies, then made sure i was interacting with the one that matches my id(param). then using my spread operator, i just expanded and increased the like for the particular movie +1 and also added 5$ to the initial price, when the like count is greter than 7, it enters the featured section.
